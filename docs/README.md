## Help, i cant see code in my editor!

Some files under this repo are organized with [Vim Folds](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Folding). Vim folds allows code to be grouped into logical sections, like a `Font` fold, or a `Keyboard Shortcuts` fold. These folds will give an overview by each folds name, letting you find important sections of a file quickly.

If you have not used folds in vim before, its `zR` to open all folds, `zM` to close all folds. There is also `za` to toggle individual levels of folds.
