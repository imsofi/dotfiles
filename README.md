# dotfiles

My own personal repo containing my dotfiles plus extras.

## configs/

This folder holds my configuration files, (also called dotfiles) together with
mangement scripts to help install/remove them.

## keyboard/

This is my custom keyboard remapping solution. It allows me to rebind keys on any
linux laptop. An example is turning Capslock into both an ESC and a CTRL key at
the same time.

## setup/

My Ansible scripts for configuring new installs of my computer.
